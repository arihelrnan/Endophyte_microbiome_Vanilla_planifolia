# Flow data of 16SrRNA and ITS amplicons

`bin` directory is divided in this two subdirectories: 
1. `16S_data/`. Here there are contain scripts necessary to process data of 16SrRNA amplicons. 
2. `ITS_data/`. Here there are contain scripts necessary to process data of ITS amplicons. 

Scripts structure between this two subdirectories is very similar, but we recomended run flow data separately. Necesary input files are content in `../Data/` directory. Scripts content necessary rutes to load input files and save output files content in `../Data/`.
