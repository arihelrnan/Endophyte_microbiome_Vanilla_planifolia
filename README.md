# Introduction
The susceptibility of _Vanilla planifolia_ to certain fungal agents may be mediated by the interaction of the plant with its microbiomes. One of these fungi, Fusarium oxysporum, causes stem and root rot disease, which is particularly devastating in vanilla plantations. It has been observed that the diversity of microbiomes in the cultivation soil and the presence of certain microorganisms in the microbiomes influence the development of this disease. However, the role that the endophyte microbiome may be playing in the development of the disease has not been fully explored. Based on the sequencing analysis of the 16SrRNA and ITS markers, in this study we analyzed and compared the diversity of fungi and bacteria of endophytic microbiomes associated with roots and stems in asymptomatic and symptomatic plants, as well as in wild Vanilla planifolia plants. Analysing of the microbiomes of wild plants is a strategy to understand the role of the microbiome of wild plants in disease tolerance. In this repository, the procedure by which the bioinformatic analysis of the data was carried out is detailed. First step consist in quality control of the reads, OTU Clustering and Taxonomic Annotation. Second step consist in analysis of alpha diversity and beta diversity, with their respective visualizations and hypothesis tests. Third step consisted of visualizing taxonomic diversity and comparing the abundance of taxa between groups. 
# Description
This repository is divided in 3 directories: 
1.	**bin.** This directory is subdivided in three directories: "1_Sequence_processing", "2_Normalizing_and_diversity_analysis", "3_Taxonomic_abundance_analysis". Inside each repositories, there are two scripts. one to 16S data and another to ITS data. The number of the directories correspond to order of the scripts in the process. 
2.	**Data.** It contains the OTU table of 16SrRNA data and other of ITS data. They are output file in the script "1_Sequence_processing", and they are input files in the another scripts. Also, here are contined a "mapping_file.txt", that describe the sample groups.  
3.	**Figures.** Graphics and visualizations that are output files of scripts of Diversity analysis.
